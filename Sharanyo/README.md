This is a simple Python script that converts currencies using the Exchange Rate API.

To use the script, simply run it and follow the prompts. The script will then convert the given amount from the specified currency to the specified currency.

The script uses the Exchange Rate API to get the current exchange rate between the two currencies. If the exchange rate is not available, the script will return a message indicating that the conversion is not possible.

To use the script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the script is located, and typing "python currency.py". This will start the script and run it in the terminal.

If you want to run the script from a different directory, you can specify the full path to the script file when running it. For example, if the script is located in the "Documents" directory, you can run it by typing "python /Users/sharanyo/Documents/currency.py".

Note that the script assumes that the Exchange Rate API is available and that it is accessible from the internet. If the API is not available or if there is a problem with your internet connection, the script may not work properly.

I hope this script is helpful for anyone who wants to learn how to use the Exchange Rate API in Python. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
